# Hey there! I'm Viktor ðŸ‘‹

I love coding and I'm always experimenting with new projects to test my skills.

I'm currently learning web development, and my stack includes:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,wasm)](https://skillicons.dev)

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym or working on other projects.

Feel free to check out my work and let's connect!
