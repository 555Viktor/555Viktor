# Hey there! I'm Viktor ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning web development, and my stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CLI tools, and Webpack. I enjoy coding and I'm always experimenting with new projects to improve my skills.

When I'm not programming, you can find me at the gym or working on other projects. ðŸ˜Š

Feel free to check out my work connect!
